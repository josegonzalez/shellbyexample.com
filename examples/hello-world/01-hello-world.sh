#!/bin/sh
# Our first shell script is the classic "Hello World".
# This example demonstrates the basic structure of a
# shell script.
#
# You can run this script by saving it to a file named
# `01-hello-world.sh`, making it executable with
# `chmod +x 01-hello-world.sh`, and running
# it via `./01-hello-world.sh` in your terminal.
#
# The `echo` command prints text to standard output.
# It's one of the most commonly used commands in
# shell scripting. You can print multiple lines using
# multiple echo commands.

echo "Hello, World!"
echo "Welcome to Shell by Example!"
